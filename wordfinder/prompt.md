# Find the word!

You have a long string of letters and underscores.

Sort the characters in the following string:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_

by the number of times the character appears in that first long string (descending).

Now take the sorted string, and drop all the characters after (and including) the _

The remaining word is the answer.


## Possible extensions
Write a CLI gem that can generate the long jumbles from a given word, and can sort with various options
